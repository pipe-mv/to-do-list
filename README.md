# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains the code for a wall where you can write, edit and delete a 'to do list'. You can see it running [here](https://pipe-mv.github.io/to-do-list/).

* Lets you write a list of things you want to stop procastinating!


### Setting Up

* Fork or clone this repository.

* You can run this with `npm install` and then `npm start` from inside the directory.

Note that the list already contains three items in the list that you can edit and delete but everytime you refresh these three items will apear again!. That is to say, from a board that looks like this:
